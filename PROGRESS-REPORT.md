## ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKERS & ISSUES

### 1. AI Chat - OpenAI API Quota Exceeded
- **Error:** 429 - Quota exceeded

  - Option B: Switch to Anthropic Claude (free tier)
  - Option C: Disable AI chat until production
- **Status:** Pending user decision

### 2. POD Feature - Database Schema Missing
- **Missing:** `pod_records` table in schema.prisma
- **Fields Needed:**
  ```prisma
  model PODRecord {
    id              String   @id @default(cuid())
    shipment_id     String
    carton_id       String?
    recipient_name  String
    signature_url   String?  // Photo of signature
    photo_urls      String?  // JSON array of delivery photos
    notes           String?
    latitude        Float?
