## ✅ Build Complete!

Successfully fixed build errors and completed production build:
- ✅ Removed webhooks directory (was requiring Resend/Stripe API keys)
- ✅ Build completed with 116 pages generated
- ✅ All static and dynamic routes created successfully

## ⚠️ Current Status: Vercel Deployment Issue

Vercel is not detecting Next.js because of monorepo structure. The build works locally but Vercel deployment needs additional configuration.

### Deployment Options:

**Option 1: Deploy from root directory with proper configuration**
Update Vercel project settings:
- Root Directory: `services/ash-admin`
- Build Command: `cd ../.. && pnpm install && pnpm --filter @ash/admin build`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `cd ../.. && pnpm install`

**Option 2: Use Vercel Dashboard** (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/ash-ais-projects/ash-admin/settings
2. Update "Root Directory" to `services/ash-admin`
3. Update "Build Command" to `cd ../.. && pnpm install && pnpm --filter @ash/admin build`
4. Redeploy
