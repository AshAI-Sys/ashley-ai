- System architecture updates

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Auth is handled locally in `/api/auth/` endpoints
- No external auth service required
- Use any credentials to login

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's running on ports
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3003

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F
```

## Development Notes
- Uses Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript throughout
- Prisma ORM with SQLite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

## Commander Role Context
This system was built with Claude Code acting as a supervisor, implementing a complete 14-stage manufacturing ERP system called "ASH AI" (Apparel Smart Hub - Artificial Intelligence). All stages follow the specifications in CLIENT_UPDATED_PLAN.md.

The implementation focuses on real-world manufacturing workflows with AI-powered optimization and efficiency tracking throughout the production pipeline.
