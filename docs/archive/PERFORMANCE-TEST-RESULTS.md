## Performance Analysis

### Cold Start Pattern

All endpoints exhibit a "cold start" pattern where the first request takes 400-700ms, while subsequent requests drop to 220-270ms. This is **normal and expected** behavior due to:

1. **Database Connection Pool Initialization**
2. **Query Plan Caching** (Prisma ORM)
3. **JavaScript JIT Compilation** (Node.js V8)
4. **OS Memory Caching**

**Impact**: Minimal in production as the server stays warm with regular traffic.
