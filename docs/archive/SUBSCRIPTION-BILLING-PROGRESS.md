**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Phase 1-2 Complete, Database Schema Conflict Resolution Needed

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### **Phase 1: Subscription Tiers & Pricing Design**
‚úÖ Complete subscription tier structure defined
‚úÖ 3 main tiers: Starter ($99), Professional ($299), Enterprise ($999)
‚úÖ Custom tier for large enterprises
‚úÖ Usage-based add-ons for overages
‚úÖ Feature matrix documented
‚úÖ 14-day free trial strategy
‚úÖ Annual billing discount (20%)
‚úÖ Revenue projections (Year 1: $191K ARR, Year 2: $705K ARR)

**File Created**: `SUBSCRIPTION-TIERS.md` (detailed pricing document)

### **Phase 2: Database Schema Design**
‚úÖ Complete subscription database schema designed
‚úÖ 10 new models created:
- `SubscriptionPlan` - Define available tiers
- `Subscription` - Customer subscriptions
- `SubscriptionInvoice` - Stripe-generated invoices (renamed to avoid conflict)
- `SubscriptionPayment` - Payment tracking (renamed to avoid conflict)
- `UsageLog` - Usage metering
- `PaymentMethod` - Stored payment methods
- `BillingEvent` - Stripe webhook events
- `Coupon` - Promotions and discounts
- `CouponRedemption` - Coupon usage tracking

**File Created**: `packages/database/prisma/subscription-schema.txt`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS - Database Schema Conflicts

### **Issue Discovered**
Ashley AI already has `Invoice` and `Payment` models for the Finance Operations module (Stage 9). We need to rename the subscription billing models to avoid conflicts.

### **Resolution Strategy**
**Option A: Rename Subscription Models** (Recommended)
- `Invoice` ‚Üí `SubscriptionInvoice`
- `Payment` ‚Üí `SubscriptionPayment`
- Keep existing Finance `Invoice` and `Payment` models unchanged
- Clear separation between operational invoicing and subscription billing

**Option B: Merge Models**
- Extend existing `Invoice` model with subscription fields
- Add `invoice_type` field: 'OPERATIONAL' | 'SUBSCRIPTION'
- More complex but unified invoice system

**Recommendation**: Use Option A for clean separation of concerns.

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS

### **Immediate**
1. Update `subscription-schema.txt` with renamed models:
   - `Invoice` ‚Üí `SubscriptionInvoice`
   - `Payment` ‚Üí `SubscriptionPayment`

2. Update Workspace model relations in `schema.prisma`:
   ```prisma
   subscription_invoices SubscriptionInvoice[]
   subscription_payments SubscriptionPayment[]
   ```

3. Remove duplicate schema from `schema.prisma` and re-append corrected version

4. Run `npx prisma generate` to create client

### **Phase 3: Stripe Integration** (Pending)
- Stripe account setup
- API key configuration
- Product/Price creation in Stripe
- Webhook endpoint implementation
- Subscription creation flow
- Payment processing
- Invoice generation

### **Phase 4: Subscription API** (Pending)
- Create subscription management endpoints
- Usage tracking middleware
- Overage calculation
- Plan upgrade/downgrade
- Subscription cancellation

### **Phase 5: Billing Dashboard** (Pending)
- Subscription overview card
- Usage meters with progress bars
- Invoice list with download
- Payment method management
- Plan upgrade UI

## üéØ Architecture Overview

### **Subscription Flow**
```
1. User signs up ‚Üí Create Workspace
2. Start trial ‚Üí Create Subscription (status: TRIALING)
3. Add payment method ‚Üí Create PaymentMethod
4. Trial ends ‚Üí Stripe creates SubscriptionInvoice
5. Auto-charge ‚Üí Create SubscriptionPayment
6. Track usage ‚Üí Record UsageLog entries
7. Month ends ‚Üí Calculate overages, generate invoice
8. Repeat monthly billing cycle
```

### **Usage Tracking**
```typescript
// Middleware to track API calls
async function trackAPIUsage(workspaceId: string) {
  await prisma.usageLog.create({
    data: {
      subscription_id: sub.id,
      workspace_id: workspaceId,
      usage_type: 'API_CALLS',
      quantity: 1,
      period_start: sub.current_period_start,
      period_end: sub.current_period_end
    }
  })
}

// Reset monthly counters
async function resetUsageCounters(subscriptionId: string) {
  await prisma.subscription.update({
    where: { id: subscriptionId },
    data: {
      orders_used: 0,
      api_calls_used: 0,
      usage_reset_at: new Date()
    }
  })
}
```

### **Stripe Webhook Handlers**
```typescript
// Handle subscription events
const webhookHandlers = {
  'customer.subscription.created': handleSubCreated,
  'customer.subscription.updated': handleSubUpdated,
  'customer.subscription.deleted': handleSubDeleted,
  'invoice.paid': handleInvoicePaid,
  'invoice.payment_failed': handlePaymentFailed,
  'payment_intent.succeeded': handlePaymentSuccess,
}
```
