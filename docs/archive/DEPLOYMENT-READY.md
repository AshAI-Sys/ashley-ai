## After Deployment

### 1. Verify Deployment

```powershell
# Open Railway dashboard
railway open

# Check deployment logs
railway logs

# Get your live URL
railway domain
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations

Once deployed, Railway will automatically run:

```bash
cd packages/database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Access Your App

**Live URL**: Will be provided by `railway domain`

**Default Login**:

- Email: admin@ashleyai.com
- Password: password123

### 4. Post-Deployment Testing

**Smoke Tests** (Manual):

1. Visit homepage → Should load Ashley AI interface
2. Login → Should authenticate successfully
3. Dashboard → Should display metrics
4. Orders → Should show orders page
5. Finance → Should load finance dashboard
6. HR & Payroll → Should show employee list

**Performance Tests** (Automated):

```bash
# Run k6 smoke test against live site
k6 run -e API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app tests/performance/k6-api-load-test.js
```
