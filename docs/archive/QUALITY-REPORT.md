- **React Testing Library** integrated for component testing
- **JSDOM environment** for browser API simulation
- **Parallel execution** enabled for fast test runs
- **Code coverage** reporting with Istanbul

#### 1.2 Comprehensive Test Setup
```javascript
// tests/setup/jest.setup.js
- ✅ Testing Library matchers
- ✅ Fetch polyfill (node-fetch)
- ✅ TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills
- ✅ IntersectionObserver mock
- ✅ ResizeObserver mock
- ✅ Next.js router mock

```

#### 1.3 Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/           ✅ Unit tests (41 tests)
├── integration/    ✅ Integration tests (21 tests)
├── e2e/            ✅ E2E tests (13 tests)
├── security/       ⚠️ Security tests (40 tests - require server)
├── performance/    ✅ K6 load tests
└── setup/          ✅ Global test configuration
```

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Security Tests Require Manual Server Start**
   - Security tests need localhost:3001 running
   - Should use test database or mock server
   - **Recommendation**: Add Docker Compose for test environment

2. **Load Testing Not Automated**
   - K6 tests exist but not in CI pipeline
   - **Recommendation**: Add k6 to CI/CD workflow

## 2. Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage: **0%** (Mock-based tests)

The current tests are primarily mock-based and don't execute actual application code, resulting in 0% measured coverage. However, the tests validate business logic patterns effectively.

#### Coverage by Category

| File Type | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| All files | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| API Routes | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Utilities | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Components | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

#### Configured Thresholds

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 70%,
    functions: 70%,

## 5. Performance Assessment

### Load Testing Infrastructure

**Tool**: K6 Load Testing
**Location**: `tests/performance/load-test.js`

#### Test Scenarios Configured

```javascript
stages: [
  { duration: '2m', target: 10 },   // Ramp up to 10 users
  { duration: '5m', target: 50 },   // Stay at 50 users
  { duration: '2m', target: 100 },  // Ramp up to 100 users
  { duration: '5m', target: 100 },  // Stay at 100 users
  { duration: '2m', target: 0 },    // Ramp down
]
```

#### Performance Thresholds

```javascript
thresholds: {
  http_req_duration: ['p(95)<2000'],  // 95% under 2s
  http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],      // < 10% error rate
}
```

#### Endpoints Tested

- `/api/health` - Health check
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard page load
