## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Keys to Perfect Security

1. **Start Early**: Build security from day one
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection
3. **Automate Everything**: Don't rely on manual processes

5. **Stay Updated**: Threats evolve, so must defenses
6. **Document Everything**: Clear policies and procedures
7. **Educate Users**: Security is a team effort

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

- ❌ Storing passwords in plain text → ✅ bcrypt hashing
- ❌ Using 'unsafe-eval' in CSP → ✅ Nonce-based CSP
- ❌ No rate limiting → ✅ Redis-based rate limiting
- ❌ No session timeout → ✅ 30min inactivity timeout
- ❌ Weak passwords allowed → ✅ 12+ char complexity
- ❌ No account lockout → ✅ 5 attempts = 30min lock
- ❌ Trusting file uploads → ✅ Magic byte validation
