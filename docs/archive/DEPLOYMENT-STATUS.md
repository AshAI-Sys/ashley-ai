# Ashley AI - Deployment Status & Final Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Build succeeds but shows 404 - OUTPUT DIRECTORY PROBLEM

## Current Problem

✅ **Build**: Succeeds
❌ **Website**: Shows 404 NOT_FOUND
**Reason**: Vercel can't find the built `.next` directory

---

## FINAL FIX - Do This Now!

### Step 1: Update Vercel Dashboard Settings

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/ash-ais-projects/ash-admin/settings/general

**Configure these settings**:

1. **Root Directory**: `services/ash-admin` ← **CRITICAL!**
2. **Framework Preset**: Next.js
3. **Build Command**: (leave as default or empty)
4. **Output Directory**: (leave as default `.next`)
5. **Install Command**: (leave as default)
6. **Node.js Version**: `20.x`

**Click SAVE**

---

### Step 2: Delete service-level vercel.json

The `services/ash-admin/vercel.json` is conflicting with dashboard settings!

**Delete it** or **rename it** to `vercel.json.bak`

---

### Step 3: Update Root vercel.json

Use this simple config:

```json
{
  "version": 2
}
```

---

### Step 4: Redeploy

After updating settings:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/ash-ais-projects/ash-admin
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. Wait for completion

## Why This Fixes It

**Problem**: Vercel is building from MONOREPO ROOT but looking for files in WRONG location

**Solution**:

- Set **Root Directory** = `services/ash-admin`
- This makes Vercel build FROM the correct directory
- `.next` output will be in the RIGHT place
- No more 404!

---

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If dashboard settings don't work, deploy manually:

```bash
cd services/ash-admin
vercel --prod
```

Follow prompts and it should work!

## Expected Result

After fix:

- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Website loads at: https://ash-admin-ash-ais-projects.vercel.app
- ✅ Login page appears
- ✅ Dashboard works
