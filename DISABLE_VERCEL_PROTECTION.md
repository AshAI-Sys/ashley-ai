# üîì Disable Vercel Deployment Protection

## Issue
Vercel is blocking public access to your website with "Authentication Required" page.

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Go to Project Settings:**
   https://vercel.com/ash-ais-projects/ash-admin/settings/deployment-protection

2. **Find "Deployment Protection"** section

3. **Change setting to:**
   - Select **"Disable Protection"** or
   - Select **"Only Preview Deployments"**

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Test your website** - It should now work without authentication!

### Option 2: Use Production Domain

Your production domain should work without protection:
- Check: https://vercel.com/ash-ais-projects/ash-admin/settings/domains
- Look for the main production URL (not the deployment-specific URL)

---

## Current URLs

**Deployment URL (with protection):**
- https://ash-admin-mdyhxlx9u-ash-ais-projects.vercel.app

**Main Production Domain (should work):**
- Usually: https://ash-admin.vercel.app or
- Your custom domain if configured

---

## After Disabling Protection

Your website will be publicly accessible at:
- All deployment URLs
- Production domain

**Login credentials remain secure:**
- Email: `admin@ashleyai.com`
- Password: `Admin@12345`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

Deployment Protection is a Vercel FREE tier feature that blocks public access by default. You need to:
1. Either disable it completely, or
2. Configure it to only protect preview deployments

This won't affect your authentication system - your login will still require email/password!
