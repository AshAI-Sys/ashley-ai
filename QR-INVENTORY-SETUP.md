## üöÄ How to Access

1. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   cd services/ash-admin
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Open**: http://localhost:3001

3. **Login**: Use your admin credentials

4. **Navigate**: Look for "Retail Store" in the sidebar (üè™ icon)

---

## üìã QR Code Format

According to specifications, QR codes use this format:

```
https://inventory.yourdomain.com/i/{product_id}?v={variant_id}
```

### Examples:
- Product only: `https://inventory.yourdomain.com/i/clx123abc`
- With variant: `https://inventory.yourdomain.com/i/clx123abc?v=clx456def`

### QR Code Fields in Database:
- `ProductVariant.qr_code` - Stores the QR URL
- `ProductVariant.barcode` - Optional traditional barcode

---

## üîß QR Code Generation (Final Step)

A QR code generator component has been created at:
`services/ash-admin/src/components/qr-code-generator.tsx`

### To Complete QR Integration:

1. **Install QR library**:
   ```bash
   cd services/ash-admin
   pnpm add qrcode @types/qrcode
   ```

2. **Update the QR component** to use the library:
   ```typescript
   import QRCode from 'qrcode';

   const generateQRCode = async () => {
     const url = variantId
       ? `${baseUrl}/i/${productId}?v=${variantId}`
       : `${baseUrl}/i/${productId}`;

     if (canvasRef.current) {
       await QRCode.toCanvas(canvasRef.current, url, {
         width: size,
         margin: 2,
       });
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Add QR modal to Admin Dashboard** Products tab:
   - Import the QRCodeGenerator component
   - Add "View QR" button to each product card
   - Show QR code in a modal when clicked

4. **Alternative**: Use `react-qr-code` for simpler integration:
   ```bash
   pnpm add react-qr-code
   ```

   ```tsx
   import QRCode from 'react-qr-code';

   <QRCode value={qrUrl} size={256} />
   ```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### 1. Database Setup
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables
- [ ] Verify 8 new tables exist in database
- [ ] Create test locations (STORE_MAIN, WH_MAIN)

### 2. Admin Dashboard Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/inventory/retail/admin`
- [ ] Create a test product (e.g., "T-Shirt Red")
- [ ] Create product variants (Small, Medium, Large)
- [ ] Create store locations (STORE_MAIN, WH_MAIN)
- [ ] Generate inventory report

### 3. Warehouse Operations Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/inventory/retail/warehouse`
- [ ] **Receive Delivery**: Add 100 units to WH_MAIN
- [ ] Verify stock appears in database
- [ ] **Transfer Stock**: Move 50 units from WH_MAIN to STORE_MAIN
- [ ] Verify stock levels update correctly
- [ ] **Adjust Stock**: Deduct 5 units (DAMAGED reason)
- [ ] Verify adjustment logged in stock_ledger

### 4. Store Interface Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/inventory/retail/store`
- [ ] Enter product ID manually (use format: `clx123abc?v=clx456def`)
- [ ] Verify product details display correctly
- [ ] Check stock by location shows correct quantities
- [ ] Test out-of-stock product (0 units)

### 5. Cashier/POS Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/inventory/retail/cashier`
- [ ] Add multiple products to cart
- [ ] Apply discount (e.g., 10%)
- [ ] Adjust tax (default 12%)
- [ ] Process sale with CASH payment
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify stock auto-deducted from STORE_MAIN
- [ ] Check sale recorded in `retail_sales` table
- [ ] Verify stock_ledger has SALE transaction

### 6. End-to-End Flow
```
1. Admin creates product "Blue Jeans - 32" (Admin Dashboard)
2. Warehouse receives 200 units from supplier (Warehouse Interface)
3. Warehouse transfers 100 units to STORE_MAIN (Warehouse Interface)
4. Store clerk scans product to check stock (Store Interface)
5. Cashier sells 3 units to customer (Cashier Interface)
6. Admin generates low stock report (Admin Dashboard)
7. Verify all stock movements in stock_ledger table
```

## üìä Database Queries for Verification

### Check Stock by Location
```sql
SELECT
  v.sku,
  l.location_code,
  SUM(s.quantity_change) as total_stock
FROM stock_ledger s
JOIN product_variants v ON s.variant_id = v.id
JOIN store_locations l ON s.location_id = l.id
GROUP BY v.sku, l.location_code;
```

### View All Sales
```sql
SELECT
  rs.sale_number,
  rs.total_amount,
  rs.payment_method,
  COUNT(rsi.id) as item_count
FROM retail_sales rs
LEFT JOIN retail_sale_items rsi ON rs.id = rsi.sale_id
GROUP BY rs.id
ORDER BY rs.sale_date DESC;
```

### Audit Trail for Product
```sql
SELECT
  sl.transaction_type,
  sl.quantity_change,
  sl.quantity_before,
  sl.quantity_after,
  l.location_code,
  sl.notes,
  sl.created_at
FROM stock_ledger sl
JOIN store_locations l ON sl.location_id = l.id
WHERE sl.variant_id = 'YOUR_VARIANT_ID'
ORDER BY sl.created_at DESC;
```

## üîí Security Notes

All endpoints require authentication:
- Uses `requireAuth()` middleware
- Enforces workspace isolation
- All operations logged in stock_ledger for audit

---

## üéØ User Roles

Per specifications, 4 user roles:
1. **Admin** - Full access to all modules
2. **Cashier** - Access to POS system only
3. **Clerk** (Store Staff) - Access to Store Interface only
4. **Warehouse Staff** - Access to Warehouse Interface only

**Note**: Role-based access control (RBAC) can be added to `requireAuth()` middleware based on user role.

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Stock Ledger Pattern**: All stock movements go through ledger (no direct stock column)
- **Real-time Calculation**: Stock = SUM(quantity_change) grouped by variant + location
- **Indexes**: Database has indexes on:
  - `workspace_id` (all tables)
  - `variant_id` + `location_id` (stock_ledger)
  - `sku` (product_variants - unique)
  - `location_code` + `workspace_id` (store_locations - unique)

---

## üêõ Known Issues / TODO

1. **QR Scanner**: Camera scanning not yet implemented
   - **Current**: Manual input only
   - **TODO**: Integrate `@zxing/browser` for camera scanning

2. **QR Code Generation**: Placeholder only
   - **Current**: Shows placeholder text
   - **TODO**: Install `qrcode` and implement real QR generation

3. **Receipt Printing**: Not implemented
   - **TODO**: Add receipt generation after sale

4. **Stock Count**: No physical inventory count feature
   - **TODO**: Add stock count workflow for periodic audits
