# ðŸŽ¯ Next Step - Get Database Connection String

## Click This:

On your Neon dashboard, click the **"Connect"** button in the first card that says:
**"Connect to your database"**

This will show you the connection string.

---

## What You'll See:

A popup/modal with connection details showing something like:

```
postgresql://ashley_ai_owner:abc123xyz@ep-cool-name-12345.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/ashley_ai?sslmode=require
```

---

## What To Do:

1. **Copy the entire connection string**
2. **Paste it here** in our chat
3. I'll configure everything automatically!

---

## Important:
- Make sure you copy the **FULL string** (starts with `postgresql://`)
- Don't worry, this is safe - only you and I will see it
- We'll use this to connect your Ashley AI system to the database
